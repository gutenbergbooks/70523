<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">A</span>NY Judicious Man, who will be at the pains attentively to read the
following Speeches, and compare them with the Papers left by Lord
<i>Derwentwater</i>, Colonel <i>Oxburgh</i>, and the other Rebels
lately executed, must soon be convinc’d, That they all proceed from the
same Mint, and are fram’d on purpose to spirit up the Faction to a New
Rebellion.</p>

<p>There’s such an Uniformity in the Stile, Matter, and Way of Arguing,
as sufficiently proves this; so that instead of being the Speeches of
the deceas’d Rebels, they plainly appear to be the Composure of others,
who endeavour to serve the Cause not only at the Expence of those poor
Mens Reputation, but even of their Souls, by prevailing upon them to
deliver such Papers as their dying Sentiments, and the Result of their
own Thoughts.</p>

<p>This is very plain in the Case of Mr. <i>Hall</i>, who being ask’d at
the Place of Execution, if the Paper he deliver’d was writ by himself,
he avoided giving a direct Answer, and only said it contain’d his
Sentiments; tho ’tis highly probable he never carefully read it, if we
consider the notorious Falshood which he is made to assert, <i>That the
Rebels conquer’d the King’s Troops at</i> Preston.</p>

<p>Besides, he and Mr. <i>Paul</i> were so far from being stedfast to the
Pretender’s Interest, as is given out in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span> the Speeches, and so little
fond of what they call Martyrdom, that ’tis very well known they us’d
all possible Endeavours to save their Lives, would have disown’d the
Pretender’s Claim, and renew’d their Oaths to the Government, could
they have obtain’d their Pardon on that Condition. The Speech-makers
were not ignorant of this, but they resolv’d to delude the unthinking
Populace, and to make those Men pass for Valiant and Glorious Martyrs;
tho, in truth, they liv’d and dy’d the most hateful Dissemblers, both
with God and Man, that ever were heard of.</p>

<p>But to come to the Speeches themselves.</p>


<p class="center">Mr. <i>PAUL</i>’s SPEECH.</p>

<p><i>Good People, I am just going to make my Appearance in the other
World, where I must give an Account of all the Actions of my past Life:
and tho I have endeavour’d to make my Peace with God, by sincerely
repenting of all my Sins, yet forasmuch as several of them are of a
Publick Nature, I take it to be my Duty to declare here, in the Face of
the World, my hearty Abhorrence and Detestation of them.</i></p>


<p class="center"><i>REMARKS.</i></p>

<p>’Tis easy to perceive that this Paragraph is calculated to gain Credit
to what he was afterwards to say; but the judicious Reader will
discover the Artifice, and that the Author is far from being ingenuous.
’Tis very odd, in a Protestant Divine, to talk of <i>making his Peace
with God, by a sincere Repentance of all his Sins</i>, and not say one
Word of Faith in the Merits of Jesus Christ; without which, Repentance
can neither be sincere nor perfect. This looks so like the Popish
Doctrine, that Penance is a sufficient Atonement for Sin, as gives
every one just Cause to suspect the Author’s Religion.</p>

<p>He takes notice, that several of his Sins were of a Publick Nature,
and that he thought it his Duty to declare his hearty Abhorrence and
Detestation of them in the Face of the World; but how much he juggled
in this Matter, will be evident by the two following Paragraphs, and
the Reflections upon them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span></p>


<p class="center">The SPEECH.</p>

<p><i>And first, I ask Pardon of God and the King, for having violated
my Loyalty, by taking most abominable Oaths in Defence of Usurpation,
against my Lawful Sovereign King</i> James <i>the Third</i>.</p>

<p><i>And as I ask Pardon of all Persons whom I have injur’d or offended,
so I do especially desire Forgiveness of all those whom I have
scandaliz’d by pleading Guilty. I am sensible that it is a Base and
Dishonourable Action; that it is inconsistent with my Duty to the King,
and an entire Surrender of my Loyalty. Human Frailty, and too great a
Desire of Life, together with the Persuasions of several who pretended
to be my Friends, were the Occasion of it. I trust God of his infinite
Mercy, upon my sincere Repentance, has forgiven me; and I hope all good
Christians will.</i></p>


<p class="center"><i>REMARKS.</i></p>

<p>Since the Author owns, that several of his Sins were of a Publick
Nature, he ought to have been very particular and exact in the
Enumeration of them; but he mentions only two, <i>viz.</i> his taking
what he calls most abominable Oaths in Defence of Usurpation, and his
pleading Guilty to his Indictment.</p>

<p>He must be a very superficial Reader, who does not observe, that these
things, which Mr. <i>Paul</i> calls Sins, were attended with others of
as heinous and publick a Nature; of which he says not one Word. For his
taking the Oaths, if he thought them abominable, was not only a Crime
against his pretended Lawful Sovereign, King <i>James</i> III. but a
dreadful mocking of God, and treacherous Imposition upon the present
Government, and his Country; and so much the more, that he continu’d in
this abominable Practice till the time the Rebellion broke out: and it
was aggravated by this heinous Circumstance, That he went from the very
Pulpit in which he preach’d by the Authority of the present Government,
to join those who rose in Arms against it. Had he been a sincere
Penitent, such hateful Prevarication with God and Man must have star’d
him in the Face, and call’d for an express and humble Acknowledgment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
of it; whereas he confines his Repentance to what he did against the
Loyalty which he fancies he ow’d the Pretender.</p>

<p>One might have expected, from a true and ingenuous Penitent, an Account
of the Reasons why he calls the present Government an Usurpation:
for tho perhaps he might think, that the Word of a dying Priest
was Authority enough for the Bigots of his Party, he ought to have
consider’d, that others would expect very strong and convincing
Arguments to prove, that his single Judgment should be prefer’d not
only to that of our present Legislature, but of all our Parliaments;
who, ever since we were a Nation, have asserted it to be their
indisputed Right to dethrone Tyrants, and to settle the Succession
in such a manner as they thought most conducible to preserve the
Liberties of the People. Nothing can be more evident than this in
all our Histories and Acts of Parliament before the Reformation; and
he must have been prodigiously ignorant, if he did not know that.
It has been the Practice, as well as the Principle of the Church of
<i>England</i> since she became Protestant: For all the World knows,
that in the beginning of the Reformation, under <i>Henry</i> VIII. she
own’d the Power of Parliaments, in settling the Succession, about which
there were several Acts made in his Reign. In that of his Son, King
<i>Edward</i> VI. it appears plain enough that the leading Protestants
were of the same mind, when they agreed to set aside his Popish
Sister Queen <i>Mary</i>, and to settle the Crown on Lady <i>Jane
Grey</i>. And ’tis as well known, that the famous Martyr, Bishop
<i>Ridley</i>, did openly preach against Queen <i>Mary</i>’s Title, at
<i>Paul</i>’s-Cross.</p>

<p>In Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>’s Reign it appears, by the Records of
Parliament, that the Bishops of the Church of <i>England</i> did
unanimously agree not only to set aside the Title of <i>Mary</i>
the Popish Queen of <i>Scots</i>, who was next Heiress to the
<i>English</i> Crown; but also to take off her Head, because of her
Plots against Queen <i>Elizabeth</i>. ’Tis no less evident, from the
History of that Reign, That the Bishops and Clergy of <i>England</i>
enabled the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span> Queen, by their Purses and otherwise, to support the
Protestants of <i>France</i> and the <i>Netherlands</i>, who had
taken Arms against their Tyrannical Sovereigns; and also those of
<i>Scotland</i>, who had dethron’d the Mother, and set up the Son.
In the Reign of King <i>James</i> I. the Church of <i>England</i>
concurred in like manner to support the Protestants of the <i>United
Netherlands</i> and <i>Germany</i> against their Tyrannical Princes;
and they continu’d the same Endeavours in the Reign of King
<i>Charles</i> I. when even Archbishop <i>Laud</i>, the Idol of our
High-Church Clergy, concurred in granting Subsidies for the Support
of the <i>French</i> Protestants, who were in Arms against their
persecuting Sovereign. What the Church of <i>England</i> did towards
dethroning King <i>James</i> II. for his Tyranny, is too late to be
forgot; and Mr. <i>Paul</i> cannot but know, that she annually thanks
God in her Office on the 5th of <i>November</i>, for bringing over the
Prince of <i>Orange</i>, and making all Opposition fall before him,
till he became our King and Governour. This, no doubt, he frequently
concurred in; and had his Jacobite Repentance been sincere, he ought
to have acknowledg’d that as publickly as the other things, which he
thought it his Duty to declare in the Face of the World.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, it appears to be of too great Importance for the
Speech-makers to think, that Mr. <i>Paul</i>’s bare Assertion, without
any Argument, was sufficient to weigh down such a Train of Authorities.</p>

<p>His begging Pardon of those whom he has scandaliz’d by pleading Guilty,
is the Form which the Ghostly Fathers of the Rebels have put into
all their Mouths; as appears by Lord <i>Derwentwater</i>’s Speech,
<i>&amp;c.</i> But since he calls this a base and dishonourable Action,
inconsistent with his Duty to the King, and an entire Surrender of his
Loyalty; it deserv’d a greater Act of Contrition, than to ascribe it
barely to human Frailty, a too great Desire of Life, and the Persuasion
of pretended Friends. Here again he shews himself a very loose
Protestant, when he relies upon his own Repentance, without one word of
our Saviour’s Merits for a Pardon at the hands of God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>


<p class="center">The SPEECH.</p>

<p><i>You see, my Countrymen, by my Habit, that I die a Son, tho a very
unworthy one, of the Church of</i> England: <i>but I would not have
you think that I am a Member of the Schismatical Church, whose Bishops
set themselves up in opposition to those Orthodox Fathers, who were
unlawfully and invalidly depriv’d by the Prince of</i> Orange. <i>I
declare that I renounce that Communion, and that I die a Dutiful
and Faithful Member of the Nonjuring Church; which has kept it self
free from Rebellion and Schism, and has preserv’d and maintain’d
true Orthodox Principles, both as to Church and State. And I desire
the Clergy, and all Members of the Revolution-Church, to consider
what Bottom they stand upon, when their Succession is grounded upon
an Unlawful and Invalid Deprivation of Catholick Bishops; the only
Foundation of which Deprivation, is a pretended Act of Parliament.</i></p>


<p class="center"><i>REMARKS.</i></p>

<p>Here’s a new Discovery, for which the World is oblig’d to the
Speech-makers, that the Habit makes a Son, or a Priest, of the Church.
It had been well for the She-Comedian, who acted <i>Roxellana</i>,
that this Doctrine had obtain’d in the Reign of King <i>Charles</i>
II. for then she might have been a Countess without Dispute, and her
Son Heir to an antient Earldom, because she was marry’d to an Earl by
his Coachman in a Priest’s Habit. Parson <i>Paul</i> might also have
been better inform’d by his good Friends the Papists, among whom ’tis a
common Proverb, <i>Cuculla non facit Monachum</i>, That the Coul does
not make a Monk: but the plain Design of this Paragraph is to incense
the Mob against the Government, as if they were going to hang up the
Church. That was the Reason why Mr. <i>Paul</i> went to <i>Tyburn</i>
in his Priest’s Vestments, which he needed not have done. We know
the time when the Clergy took a great deal of Care to prevent such a
Scandal to their Cloth, and that was when they degraded the Reverend
Mr. <i>Sam. Johnson</i>, before he was whipt, for writing against
Popery and Tyranny; tho he had more Honesty, and a better Title to his
Orders, than any of those who pretended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span> to take them from him. But
this lets us see where the Blame lies, if carrying Mr. <i>Paul</i>
to <i>Tyburn</i> in his Priest’s Vestments was a Disgrace to the
Church. There are some in the World, who think the Character of a
Jacobite Priest indelible, tho they did not think so of that Brave and
Learned Patriot, Mr. <i>Johnson</i>. But however that is, ’tis no more
Reflection upon the Government, that Priests should be hang’d in their
Habit, than kill’d in the Field for Rebellion; and this we may venture
to say, that Parson <i>Paul</i> dishonour’d the Habit more by wearing
it in the Pulpit, than at the Gallows.</p>

<p>At the same time his Friends have a very good way to make themselves
amends, by laying up his Vestments with those of St. <i>Garnet</i>
and <i>Faux</i>, where the Bigots may adore them as precious Relicks;
and perhaps this was the reason why the Parson would not die in a
Lay-Habit, tho he was disguis’d in one, when taken up for his Treason.</p>

<p>The World is farther oblig’d to this Priest, for another important
Discovery; to wit, that he was not a Member of the Schismatical Church,
but dy’d a dutiful and faithful Member of the Nonjuring Church of
<i>England</i>, which has kept it self free from Rebellion and Schism,
and has preserv’d and maintain’d true Orthodox Principles, both as to
Church and State. The Folly and Inconsistency of this Declaration is
evident at first View, and the Malice of it is what ill became a dying
Man. ’Tis well enough known that he liv’d a <i>Priest</i>, tho he did
not die a <i>Member</i>, of what he call’d the Schismatical Church;
and he continu’d in her Communion till he went to join the Rebels at
<i>Preston</i>. This is another of his publick Sins, which he forgot in
his Enumeration of ’em in the beginning of his Speech; but he thinks to
atone for that, by renouncing her Communion at Death.</p>

<p>’Tis pleasant to hear his Reasons for calling the Establish’d Church
Schismatical, and that is, because her Bishops set themselves up
in opposition to those Orthodox Fathers, who were unlawfully and
invalidly depriv’d by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span> Prince of <i>Orange</i>. So that according
to him the Church of <i>England</i> is Schismatical, Republican, and
Antimonarchical, as well as Dissenters: but had the Speech-maker’s
Head been cool, he would have consider’d, that his Argument, were it
conclusive, could not make all the Establish’d Church Schismaticks, but
only those Bishops who came in place of his depriv’d Orthodox Fathers,
and such as liv’d under them; now all those Bishops being dead, the
Schism, according to Mr. <i>Dodwell</i>, the grand Champion of the
Party, ceas’d with them. By this we see, that the Party has no fix’d
Principle; for tho they applauded that Author, and look’d upon him as
their Oracle, yet now they differ from him: so that we find it to be
true of this Set of People, That evil Men and Seducers grow worse and
worse.</p>

<p>The Parson equally discovers his Malice and Ignorance, by finding fault
with that Deprivation; for had he ever read the Statute of Provisors,
made in the 25th of King <i>Edward</i> III. he might thereby have
known, ‘That the Church of <i>England</i> was founded in the Estate of
Prelacy, by the Kings, Earls, Barons, and other Nobles of this Realm,
to inform them and the People of the Law of God, <i>&amp;c.</i> And that
certain Possessions, as well in Fees, Lands, Rents, as in Advowsons,
which do extend to a great Value, were assign’d by the said Founders to
the Prelates, <i>&amp;c.</i>’ And since it is so, ’tis a known Maxim in Law
and Reason, That they who have a power to make, have a power to unmake:
and it will be acknowledg’d as a very good reason all over the World,
to deprive such Prelates as refuse to swear or give Allegiance to the
Government, that founded their Prelacys, and protects their Persons.</p>

<p>He might also have seen, by the 5th of the 25th of <i>Henry</i>
VIII. that the Bishops of <i>Salisbury</i> and <i>Worcester</i> were
depriv’d, because not regarding their Duties to Almighty God, nor
the Cures of their Bishopricks, they dwelt at <i>Rome</i>, and other
Parts beyond Sea, <i>&amp;c.</i> And the Reason given for this Power, then
exercis’d<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span> by the King and Parliament, is the same with that already
mention’d in the Statute of Provisors. Besides, every one knows, that
in King <i>Henry</i> VIII. and King <i>Edward</i> VI’s Time, the
Bishops held their Commissions only during the Pleasure of the Prince,
and as his Delegates.</p>

<p>If the Speech-maker’s Friends object, that this relates only to the
Temporalities of the Bishops, ’tis answer’d, that in the Commission
taken out by Archbishop <i>Cranmer</i> for his Archbishoprick, his
Power of ordaining and turning out Presbyters, is also deriv’d from the
King. The Commission is at large in Dr. <i>Burnet</i>’s History of the
Reformation, Collection of Records, p. 90.</p>

<p>But perhaps the Example of that Excellent Primate and Martyr won’t have
much weight with the High-Church Party; therefore I shall give them one
of Bishop <i>Bonner</i>, who was as Bloody and High a Churchman as any
of themselves. He took out a Commission from King <i>Henry</i> VIII. in
the Preamble of which ’tis asserted, ‘That since all Jurisdiction, both
Ecclesiastical and Civil, flow’d from the King as Supreme Head, and he
was the Foundation of all Power; it became those who exercis’d it only
at the King’s Courtesy, gratefully to acknowledg that they had it only
of his Bounty, and declare that they would deliver it up again when it
should please him to call for it.’ The Commission is exhibited at large
in Dr. <i>Burnet</i>’s History of the Reformation, Vol. 1. Collection
of Records, N<sup>o</sup> 14.</p>

<p>’Tis true, that the way of giving Temporary Commissions to Bishops for
the Exercise of their Episcopal Power, is now laid aside: but since
that Power is still deriv’d from the Sovereign, by virtue of a <i>Conge
d’Eslire</i>, ’tis impudent in our High Church Priests to complain of
the Deprivation of the Nonjurant Bishops by King <i>William</i> and
his Parliament; especially if we consider, that Bishops were antiently
chosen in Parliament, till the time of <i>Henry</i> I. and that ’tis
by Act of Parliament our Princes were impower’d to erect and confer
Bishopricks; as appears by 31 <i>H.</i> VIII. <i>c.</i> 9. &amp; 13. and by
the 37th of his Reign, <i>c.</i> 17. ’tis declar’d, ‘That Archbishops,
Bishops, Archdeacons, and other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span> Ecclesiastical Persons, have no manner
of Jurisdiction Ecclesiastical, but by and under the King, the only
undoubted Supreme Head of the Church of <i>England</i>.’</p>

<p>By the 25th <i>Henry</i> VIII. <i>c.</i> 20. the Chapter is oblig’d
in twelve Days to chuse the Person nam’d by the King in the <i>Conge
d’Eslire</i>; if they do not, his Nomination is sufficient: and the
Archbishop and Bishops, to whom the King’s Signification is directed,
are oblig’d to consecrate the Elect within twenty Days, as well as the
Chapter is to present him, on pain of a <i>Premunire</i>.</p>

<p>Yet tho the <i>English</i> Prelacy is so plainly a Creature of the
State, and enjoys all its Power and Revenues from it; our High Church
Priests are so traitorous and unconscionable, that they would have the
Bishops to enjoy part of the Legislature as an Estate by themselves,
and be capable of Posts of State, and of Ecclesiastical and Civil
Power, without any Dependence on the State: which, instead of one Pope
over <i>Christendom</i>, is to set up twenty six Independent Popes
in <i>England</i>, and run both Church and State into Anarchy and
Confusion.</p>

<p>It is in vain for them to alledg, that they dispute King
<i>William</i>’s Power, because he was not a Lawful King; for we have
heard already, that by the antient Constitution of <i>England</i>, our
Parliaments always asserted their Power to dethrone Tyrants, and to set
up such in their stead as would maintain the Nation’s Privileges.</p>

<p>The Speech enumerates so many sorts of Churches of <i>England</i>,
that it will be hard to tell, according to the Notions of the Faction,
how many they will come to at last. Here’s a Schismatical Church of
<i>England</i>, a Nonjuring Church of <i>England</i>, a Revolution
Church of <i>England</i>; he might have added a Perjuring Church of
<i>England</i>, of which he himself, and his Fellow Criminal Mr.
<i>Hall</i> were noted Members. ’Tis ridiculous to assert, that the
Nonjuring Church has kept it self free from Rebellion; for all the
World knows, that the Men of that Stamp begun what he calls the
Rebellion against the late King <i>James</i>, and they have been Rebels
to all our Sovereigns ever since: so that if any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span> Set of Men in the
Island deserve to be call’d Rebellious and Antimonarchical, ’tis they.
Was it not for Rebellion, that Mr. <i>Paul</i> and others of his Party
have lost their Lives? We know indeed, that not only the Nonjurors, but
even some others of the Church of <i>England</i>, are shy of calling it
Rebellion; yet ’tis so in the Eye of the Law, and in the Opinion of all
those Powers in <i>Europe</i>, who have own’d his Majesty’s Title. Then
let the World judg, whether Parson <i>Paul</i>’s Authority or theirs,
is most to be rely’d on.</p>

<p>’Tis perfectly ridiculous then to alledg, that the Nonjuring Church
has kept it self free from Rebellion and Schism, when they have not
only been in a Course of Rebellion ever since the Revolution, but
separated from their Brethren, and set up private Conventicles, as
well as disown’d the Head of the Church: which certainly makes them
Schismaticks in the highest sense. Nor is there a Protestant Church
in the World at this day, whose Communion they don’t reject. They may
talk then of being Catholick as long as they please, but they can be
so in no other sense than that they are for a Roman Catholick Prince,
and for such an Union with the Church of <i>Rome</i>, as is betwixt
her and the Church of <i>France</i>; which Mr. <i>Lesley</i>, the
Pretender’s Chaplain, and one of his Bishops, propos’d long ago in his
<i>Pontificate and Regale</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Paul</i> seems miserably to have forgot himself, in saying that
he dy’d a dutiful and faithful Member of the Nonjuring Church, when the
World knows that he continu’d a Member of the Establish’d Church till
the Rebellion begun; and it can be prov’d, that he wou’d have been glad
to have continu’d so, and to have own’d the present Government a very
little before his Death, tho the Speech calls it a Usurpation, could
the Promises and Oaths of such a perfidious Wretch been rely’d upon, or
thought worthy of being accepted.</p>


<p class="center">The SPEECH.</p>

<p><i>Having ask’d Forgiveness for my self, I come now to forgive others.
I pardon those, who under the Notion of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span> Friendship persuaded me to
plead Guilty. I heartily forgive all my most inveterate Enemies,
especially the Elector of</i> Hannover, <i>my Lord</i> Townshend,
<i>and all others who have been instrumental in promoting my Death</i>.
Father, forgive them! Lord Jesus, have mercy upon them, and lay not
this Sin to their Charge.</p>


<p class="center"><i>REMARKS.</i></p>

<p>After he has rail’d at the Church and State, he pretends that he has
ask’d Forgiveness for himself, and comes to forgive others; and first,
those who under the Notion of Friendship persuaded him to plead guilty.
’Tis common, we see, for those who are false themselves, to call others
False Brethren; yet ’tis evident by the Clemency shew’d to others
who pleaded guilty, that those who advis’d him to do so, were his
best Friends: but since there were such Aggravations in his Case and
Character, as made him unworthy of the like Favour, his Blood lies on
his own Head.</p>

<p>His way of forgiving others is very extraordinary, when he calls them
with his dying Breath his most inveterate Enemies; and among those, he
points out the King, under the Title of Elector of <i>Hannover</i>,
and my Lord <i>Townshend</i>. This smells of so much Rancour, that it
is not reconcilable with the Spirit of Christianity, and at the same
time it shews the height of Prevarication with God and Man; since in
his Applications for Mercy he gave the King his Royal Titles (which
he now denies him) and him whom he call’d his King at the Gallows, he
thought fit to call a Pretender in his Petitions. His pointing at my
Lord <i>Townshend</i> in such a particular manner, is to mark out that
Noble Lord to the Fury of the <i>Jacobite</i> Mobs; a piece of Revenge
that is abominable in any Man, but execrable in a dying Minister, who
knew that my Lord <i>Townshend</i> could not in Faithfulness to the
King behave himself any otherwise than he did, or become an Intercessor
for a Man of so vile a Character, as Mr. <i>Paul</i> appears to have
been, to all that know him. But the Spirit of Rage and Malice, by which
the Parson was acted to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span> last, will further appear by the following
Paragraph, and the Reflections upon it.</p>


<p class="center">The SPEECH.</p>

<p><i>The next thing I have to do, Christian Friends, is to exhort you
all to return to your Duty. Remember that King</i> James <i>the Third
is your only Rightful Sovereign, by the Laws of the Land, and the
Constitution of the Kingdom. And therefore if you would perform the
Duty of Justice to him, which is due to all Mankind, you are oblig’d
in Conscience to do all you can to restore him to his Crown: For it
is his Right, and no Man in the World besides himself can lawfully
claim a Title to it. And as it is your Duty to serve him, so it is
your Interest; for till he is restor’d, the Nation can never be happy.
You see what Miseries and Calamities have befallen these Kingdoms
by the Revolution; and I believe you are now convinc’d, by woful
Experience, that swerving from God’s Laws, and thereby putting your
selves out of his Protection, is not the way to secure you from those
Evils and Misfortunes which you are afraid of in this World. Before
the Revolution, you thought your Religion, Liberties, and Properties
in Danger; and I pray you to consider how you have preserv’d them
by Rebelling. Are they not ten times more precarious than ever? Who
can say he is certain of his Life or Estate, when he considers the
Proceedings of the present Administration? And as for your Religion,
is it not evident that the Revolution, instead of keeping out Popery,
has let in Atheism? Do not Heresies abound every day; and are not
the Teachers of false Doctrines patroniz’d by the Great Men in the
Government? This shews the Kindness and Affection they have for the
Church. And to give you another Instance of their Respect and Reverence
for it, you are now going to see a Priest of the Church of</i> England
<i>murder’d for doing his Duty. For it is not me they strike at so
particularly, but it is thro me that they would wound the Priesthood,
bring a Disgrace upon the Gown, and a Scandal upon my Sacred Function.
But they would do well to remember, that he who despises Christ’s
Priests, despises Christ; and he who despises him, despises him that
sent him.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>


<p class="center"><i>REMARKS.</i></p>

<p>After profaning the Name of our Saviour, by seeming to pray that
he would forgive those who had been instrumental in promoting Mr.
<i>Paul</i>’s Death; the Speech-maker gives himself the lye, by exciting
his Auditors to a new Rebellion: and the Motives he uses for it are
only a parcel of vulgar Topicks and bold Assertions, suited to the
Taste of the <i>Jacobite</i> Mob, without one word of Argument to
support his Propositions; for he knew the Credulity of the High-Church
Faction, and that if he cou’d prevail upon them to exert themselves
for the Pretender, they wou’d not fail in their usual brutish manner
to attempt a Revenge on those, whom he points out as his own and the
Pretender’s Enemies.</p>

<p>’Tis remarkable however, that he does not offer one Law or Text to
justify the Pretender’s Claim, which he so positively asserts, but goes
on with a pitiful Declamation, to persuade them to a new Rebellion,
from the Topicks of Interest. And he insists upon the Calamities that
have befallen these Kingdoms by the Revolution, without giving one
Instance of those Calamities. We may see the Hand of the Jesuit in this
way of Reasoning; for crafty and knavish Men always betake themselves
to Generals. In this he follows the Example of the <i>Holborn</i>
Doctor, who did what he cou’d to blacken the Revolution, and the
Methods made use of to effect it, by general Slanders, without offering
at one particular Instance to justify what he says.</p>

<p>Nothing can more demonstrate the Infatuation of Mr. <i>Paul</i>, or
those who made his Speech, than his telling the People that before
the Revolution they thought their Religion, Liberties, and Properties
in danger; and that instead of preserving them by Rebellion, they are
now become ten times more precarious than ever. Had Satan appear’d in
a visible Form, he cou’d not have utter’d any thing more deceitful
and false. By this Instance ’tis plain, that the great Accuser of the
Brethren triumphs in the Weakness, as well as the Wickedness of those
he has deluded: For even the late<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span> Archbishop <i>Sancroft</i>, and
other Patrons of the Nonjurant Party, give Mr. <i>Paul</i> the lye, as
to the first part of his Proposition, and common Sense falsifies the
latter. To prove this, we need only to observe, that <i>Sancroft</i>
and the rest of the Bishops, who refus’d to read K. <i>James</i>
II’s Declaration for Liberty of Conscience, alledg’d that it was an
Invasion upon our Civil and Religious Liberties. And because they set
forth this in their Petition to that Prince, they were committed to
the <i>Tower</i>, and brought to a Tryal as traitorous Criminals: but
to their good fortune, the Law, which they had formerly too much run
down, prevail’d against that Arbitrary Power of the Prince, which they
had so long preach’d up; and the Arguments which were made use of by
the late Lord Chief Justice <i>Pollexfen</i>, Lord <i>Sommers</i>,
and other Whigs, in behalf of the Constitution, prevail’d so far,
that they were honourably acquitted. Upon which, Dr. <i>Sancroft</i>
and his Brethren did so much resent these Tyrannical Proceedings of
King <i>James</i> II. that they concur’d with others in the Happy
Revolution: and Archbishop <i>Sancroft</i> himself, tho afterwards the
Head of the Nonjuring Party, did take the Keys of the <i>Tower</i> from
<i>Skelton</i>, K. <i>James</i>’s Lieutenant, and join’d, with other
Bishops afterwards Nonjurors, in a Declaration for applying to the
Prince of <i>Orange</i>, on the 11th of <i>December</i> 1688, after
King <i>James</i> had run away, to obtain a Parliament for securing
our Laws, Liberties, Properties, and the Church of <i>England</i> in
particular.</p>

<p>This is enough to shew, that the Heads of the Nonjurant Party were then
convinc’d that our Religion, Liberties, and Properties were in Danger;
which sufficiently confutes Mr. <i>Paul</i>’s Insinuation, that they
were not.</p>

<p>And as to the other part of his bold Assertion, that they are ten times
more precarious now than ever, common Sense and Experience give him the
Lye; for Thanks to God, we have now a Protestant, whereas we then had a
Popish King on the Throne: and Malice itself can’t say, that profess’d
Papists are contrary to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span> Law made Members of the Privy Council,
Commanders in the Army, and obtruded upon our Universities, instead of
Protestants illegally turn’d out, as was the Case in those days.</p>

<p>Besides, by the Revolution, which Mr. <i>Paul</i> thinks fit to call
a Rebellion, we have obtain’d an irrevocable Law, that none who has
been a Papist, is a Papist, or marries a Papist, shall from henceforth
sit on our Throne; but that they shall always be of the Communion of
the Church of <i>England</i>, as by Law establish’d. This is such a
Security for our Religion, as <i>England</i> never had before. And
as to our Civil Rights, Liberties, and Properties, we have, by the
Declaration of Rights, enacted into a Law, such a Security, as our
Ancestors never enjoy’d a better, nor can any Nation in <i>Europe</i>
shew the like. With what face then could this dying Traitor say, that
our Religion, Liberties, and Properties are ten times more precarious
than ever? Certainly a Man who could thus appear before the Tribunal
of Heaven, with such a Lye in his Mouth, must have been judicially
harden’d, and given up to a reprobate Sense.</p>

<p>As to his Question, Who can say he is certain of his Life or Estate,
when he considers the Proceedings of the present Administration; it is
brimful of the greatest Malice and Falshood, and utter’d on purpose
to expose the Ministry to the Rage of the Jacobite Mobs; which shews
us how sincere Mr. <i>Paul</i> was in his Professions to forgive his
Enemies. But it is our Happiness that none of the Party can say, that
the present Ministry pack Juries, or suborn Evidence, to swear Men out
of their Lives and Estates, as the Tories always did when they sat at
the Helm. Nor can Malice charge the present Ministry with bringing
<i>Quo Warranto</i>’s, to deprive Corporations of their Charters, on
pretence of having forfeited them by Tumults; as was practis’d in the
Reigns of King <i>Charles</i> and King <i>James</i> II. notwithstanding
the just occasion which the Faction has given for doing it every
where, by such groundless and barbarous Tumults and Rebellions, as
were never heard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span> of in <i>England</i> before. As to the Security of
our Lives and Estates, the Rebels themselves, who have been brought to
Tryal, can bear Witness, that they have had the Benefit of the 7th of
<i>William</i> III. which is more favourable and indulgent to Traitors,
than the Laws of <i>England</i> before the Revolution; for by this Act
they are allow’d a Copy of their Indictment five days, and a Copy of
the Pannel two days before Trial, to make their Defence by Counsel, and
Proof by Witnesses upon Oath. And the Court is oblig’d, on the Request
of the Prisoners, to assign them Counsel, who are to have free Access
to them; besides which, none can be try’d according to that Act, but on
the Oath of two lawful Witnesses, either both to the same Overt-Act, or
one to one Overt-Act, and the other to the other: which are all such
Privileges as <i>Englishmen</i> never enjoy’d before the Revolution.</p>

<p>Since all this is evident by our Statute-Books, and by Matter of Fact,
it plainly shews the Ignorance and Malice of Mr. <i>Paul</i> and his
Speech-makers.</p>

<p>As to his other Insinuation, that the Revolution, instead of keeping
out Popery, has let in Atheism, nothing but unparallel’d Impudence
could have utter’d it. The late Bishop of <i>Sarum</i> did justly
observe at <i>Sacheverel</i>’s Trial, that nothing had so much
contributed to the Growth of Atheism in the Nation, as the Clergy’s
playing fast and loose with Oaths: and as this was the avow’d Practice
of Mr. <i>Paul</i> and his Party, to take Oaths to the Government, on
purpose to undermine it, and to abjure the Pretender, while at the
same time they carry’d on his Interests; the Growth and Patronage
of Atheism; is justly ascrib’d to his own Faction. There can be no
stronger proof of this, than their Breach of solemn Leagues and Oaths,
and making the late Queen <i>Anne</i> so notoriously contradict her
self from the Throne. Besides, does not all the World know, that her
Tory Ministry, and particularly two of her Secretaries of State, were
guilty of the most avow’d Perjury? Were not the Generals of the Rebels,
as well as he who betray’d the Confederate Armies to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span> <i>France</i>,
guilty of wilful Perjury? And were not many of the High-Church Members
of the House of Commons, and the High-Church Clergy guilty of the like?
Can any thing be a greater Proof of Atheism than wilful Perjury? Does
it not deny the very Being, and all the Attributes of God Almighty?
With what face then could this dying Traitor charge others with
Atheism, of which he and his Party are so demonstrably guilty?</p>

<p>He seems to make a Distinction betwixt Atheism and Popery, and to give
the latter the Preference, which is another Proof of his Ignorance and
Malice; for every Man who has read the Casuistical Divinity of the
Jesuits, which is the very Soul and Support of Popery, must needs know,
that the whole Scheme of that Divinity is Atheistical: and therefore
it has a long time been the Opinion of some of the ablest Protestant
Divines, that it is next to impossible for a Man of Learning and
Knowledg of the World to be a Papist, and not be an Atheist at the same
time.</p>

<p>For Mr. <i>Paul</i>’s other Insinuation, that Heresies abound every
day, and that the Teachers of false Doctrines are patroniz’d by the
Great Men now in the Government, he ought to have given some well-known
Instances to support his Assertion; but his Business was to slander:
so that this needs no other Answer, than that it ill becomes those who
preach and maintain the abominable Doctrines of Popery and Slavery,
Heresies destructive to the Bodies and Souls of Men, to charge the
Ministry with patronizing the Teachers of false Doctrines, merely
because they won’t break thro Law to gratify the persecuting Humour of
High-Church, against Men who differ from their Brethren in some Matters
of Speculation, or mere Circumstantials of Religion.</p>

<p>But the true Cause of all this Malice is, that Mr. <i>Paul</i> was now
for his Rebellion brought to the Gallows, which he calls the Murder
of a Priest of the Church of <i>England</i> for doing his Duty. We
have heard before, that the Practice for which he was condemn’d to
be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span> hang’d, is directly contrary to the Doctrine of the Liturgy of
the Church of <i>England</i>; so that ’tis ridiculous as well as
hateful for him to call a due Course of Law Murder. <i>Faux</i> and
<i>Garnet</i>, when they were hang’d for the Gunpowder-Plot, and those
who suffer’d in King <i>William</i>’s time for the Assassination, went
out of the World with the like Reflections upon the Government; so
that these being only Words of course from Rebels at the Gallows, they
deserve no further regard.</p>

<p>Nothing can be more villanous and profane than the last part of this
Paragraph, where he falsly asserts, that the Priesthood was struck
at thro him, <i>&amp;c.</i> How he could reckon himself a Priest, since
he was ordain’d by a Schismatical Bishop in 1709, I can’t tell; but
be that how it will, ’tis never reckon’d a Disgrace to the Clergy
in a Protestant Country, when any of that Order are justly executed
for capital Crimes: nor was it reckon’d so even among his Brethren
the Papists in <i>Spain</i> and <i>Catalonia</i>, where Priests were
hang’d for Rebellion on both sides by the Houses of <i>Bourbon</i> and
<i>Austria</i>, according as either prevail’d; but more especially by
King <i>Philip</i>, since Mr. <i>Paul</i>’s Friends, the late Tory
Ministry, betray’d the <i>Catalans</i>: and I suppose that no body will
doubt that those two Royal Families have as great a Respect for the
Order of the Priesthood, as our High Churchmen. It is true indeed, that
the Pope, the Great High Priest, has always claim’d the sole Power of
animadverting upon the Clergy, as his own proper Sons; but one of the
most Christian Kings, who took a Bishop in Rebellion, with a Coat of
Mail upon him, knew very well how to distinguish betwixt the Priest
and the Rebel; and when the Pope demanded the Bishop to be set at
liberty as one of his Sons, the <i>French</i> King sent his Holiness
the Bishop’s Armour, and bid him see whether that was his Son’s Coat or
no; making use of the vulgar <i>Latin</i> Translation in the Case of
<i>Joseph</i>’s Coat that was sent to his Father, <i>Vide an hæc sit
tunica filii tui?</i> Had Parson <i>Paul</i> gone to the Gallows with
the Lay-Habit in which he rebell’d in <i>Lancashire</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span> and was taken
up in <i>London</i>, it might have sav’d the Honour of the Gown, but it
would have been no Argument for the Honesty of the Priest.</p>

<p>The Conclusion of this Paragraph is so very profane and blasphemous,
that it can’t be repeated without Horror. The Text here, misapply’d by
Mr. <i>Paul</i>, was spoke with relation to our Saviour’s Apostles, so
that the Missionaries of Popery and Slavery have nothing to do with
it. Our Saviour is represented by St. <i>John</i> the Divine, to walk
in the midst of the seven Golden Candlesticks; but those of Brass,
like Parson <i>Paul</i>, who rebel against Christianity, in behalf of
Antichristian Idolatry, have their Mission from the Pope and the Devil:
so that a Man cannot be a good Christian, without despising them and
him that sent them.</p>


<p class="center">The SPEECH.</p>

<p><i>And now, Beloved, if you have any Regard to your Country, which
lies bleeding under these dreadful Extremities, bring the King to his
just and undoubted Right. That is the only Way to be freed from these
Misfortunes, and to secure all those Rights and Privileges which are in
Danger at present. King</i> James <i>has promis’d to protect and defend
the Church of</i> England; <i>He has given his Royal Word to consent to
such Laws, which you your selves shall think necessary to be made for
its Preservation. And his Majesty is a Prince of that Justice, Vertue
and Honour, that you have no manner of Reason to doubt the Performance
of his Royal Promise. He studies nothing so much as how to make you all
Easy and Happy; and whenever he comes to his Kingdom, I doubt not but
you will be so.</i></p>


<p class="center"><i>REMARKS.</i></p>

<p>This Paragraph continues Parson <i>Paul</i>’s rebellious Declamation,
which is very well adapted to the Cause he dy’d for. ’Tis the Encomium
of a false Prophet upon a spurious and counterfeit Prince, who stands
attainted by our Laws as an Impostor. But were it otherwise, the Parson
dies with a Lye in his right hand as to the Character of his pretended
King: for the World knows, that instead of giving that Security<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span> which
the Parson promises in his Name for the Church of <i>England</i>, he
would not so much as take an Oath for supporting the Traitor’s dear
Brethren, the Nonjuring Episcopal Party in <i>Scotland</i>; in which
perhaps he was right, since a <i>Nonjuring Church</i> ought to have
a <i>Nonjuring King</i>. Nay, he would not so much as countenance
the Church-of-<i>England</i> Liturgy with his Presence, because he
lik’d the <i>Mass</i> in <i>Latin</i> better. In short, there wanted
nothing to make this Paragraph a compleat intelligible Lye, but that
the Parson, to the Qualities of Justice, Vertue and Honour, which
he ascribes to his King, should have added <i>Valour</i>; a Quality
as applicable to a finish’d Coward, as those of Vertue, Honour, and
Justice are to one bred up in the Idolatry of <i>Rome</i>, and the
Tyrannical Maxims of <i>France</i>: and that this is the Pretender’s
Character, we can prove by Queen <i>Anne</i>’s Speech to Parliament in

<p><i>I shall be heartily glad, good People, if what I have said has any
effect upon you, so as to be instrumental in making you perform your
Duty. It is out of my power now to do any thing more to serve the King,
than by employing some of the few Minutes I have to live in this World,
in praying to Almighty God to shower down his Blessings Spiritual
and Temporal upon his Head, to protect him and restore him, to be
favourable to his Undertaking, to prosper him here, and to reward him
hereafter. I beseech the same Infinite Goodness to preserve and defend
the Church of</i> England, <i>and to restore it to all its just Rights
and Privileges: and lastly, I pray God have mercy upon me, pardon my
Sins, and receive my Soul into his everlasting Kingdom; that with the
Patriarchs, Prophets, Apostles and Martyrs, I may praise and magnify
him for ever and ever.</i> Amen.</p>


<p class="center"><i>REMARKS.</i></p>

<p>Had not the High-Church Faction been bred up in as much Ignorance by
their Priests, as those of <i>Rome</i>, the Parson could never have
hop’d that his pitiful Rhapsody would be any way instrumental to make
them perform what he calls their Duty; which in plain <i>English</i>
(as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span> Act to oblige Papists to register their Persons and Estates,
well expresses it) is ‘to dethrone and murder his Sacred Majesty, to
destroy our present happy Establishment, to settle a Popish Pretender
on the Throne, to destroy the Protestant Religion, and cruelly to
murder and massacre its Professors.’ None but such barbarous Priests
as Mr. <i>Paul</i> could exhort them to do this, and none but such
ignorant Bigots could swallow the Suggestions of Hell as Christian
Doctrine: and since this is the way in which the High Church Party,
when brought to the Gallows, pretend to forgive their Enemies, we may
easily guess at their Clemency, had Heaven, for our Sins, have suffer’d
their Arms to prevail.</p>

<p>The Prayers of the Parson’s last Minutes for the Pretender, are
answerable to Mr. <i>Paul</i>’s Behaviour during the Course of his
Life. It would seem however, that he had forgot the Order of the
Toasts, which was follow’d by his Brethren in the last Reign, to put
the Church before the Queen; for here he has put his King before his
Church. But his Prayers are like to be equally effectual in both
respects; for God will not hear the Petitions of those who regard
Iniquity in their Hearts, as ’tis plain this Parson did.</p>

<p>He should however have told us what those Just Rights and Privileges
are, to which he prays the Church of <i>England</i> might be restor’d,
or he could not expect our <i>Amen</i>. ’Tis certain she enjoys as many
Privileges now, and is as well secur’d in them, as she has been at any
time since the Reformation. But if he meant that she should be restor’d
to all the Church-Lands, which were enjoy’d by the Secular and Regular
Clergy in time of Popery; that the Clergy should be Independent on the
State, as they pretended to be then, but could never obtain it; that
the High-Church Writ, <i>de Hæretico Comburendo</i>, should be reviv’d;
that some of the Inferior Clergy should sit in the House of Commons,
instead of the Popish Priors; that others should sit in the House of
Lords, instead of the Mitred Abbots; or, in a word, that it should be
in the power of the High-Church<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span> Clergy to King and Unking, to Christen
and Unchristen whom they pleas’d. If these are the Privileges and
Liberties he wants to have restor’d, his Prayers will never be granted
by God, because they are contrary to his reveal’d Will, nor listen’d to
by <i>Englishmen</i>, till they put off human Nature, and degenerate
into Brutes.</p>

<p>The Clergyman at last comes to take some Care of his own Soul, and
prays that his Sins may be pardon’d, and that he may be receiv’d into
the Everlasting Kingdom, among Patriarchs, Prophets, Apostles, and
Martyrs: but ’tis observable, that in his whole Speech he does not pray
for any one thing thro the Merits of Christ; which shew’d how little
he understood the Gospel that he pretended to preach, and gives us too
just Ground to conclude, that as he did not live like a Christian, he
did not die one.</p>


<p class="center">The SPEECH.</p>

<p><i>As to my Body, Brethren, I have taken no manner of Care of it: for
I value not the barbarous Part of the Sentence, of being cut down and
quartered. When I am once gone, I shall be out of the reach of my
Enemies; and I wish I had Quarters enough to send to every Parish in
the Kingdom, to testify that a Clergyman of the Church of</i> England
<i>was martyr’d for being Loyal to his King</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><i>REMARKS.</i></p>

<p>Here he tells us he had taken no manner of Care of his Body, and it is
plain, by his Speech, he took as little of his Soul, since he dy’d with
Malice in his Heart, and a Lye in his Mouth; as appears plain, if we
compare his Speech with the following Letters, which he wrote to the
Archbishop of <i>Canterbury</i>, and the Lord <i>Townshend</i>.</p>

<p>The Conclusion of this Paragraph is so very extravagant and
hypocritical, considering the Submissions which he made to the present
Ministry, that it cannot but strike the Reader with Horror, to think
that one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span> who valu’d himself upon his Sacred Function, should dare
thus to prevaricate in sight of God’s Tribunal; before which he was so
quickly to appear.</p>

<p>Since Mr. <i>Paul</i> regrets, that he had not Quarters enough for
every Parish in the Kingdom, to testify that a Clergyman of the Church
of <i>England</i> (he means his Nonjuring Church) was martyr’d for
being Loyal to his King; I shall add no more but a hearty Wish, that
his Incorrigible Brethren in Rebellion or Perjury, be they Clergy or
Laymen, may fall by the hands of Justice to supply that Defect.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="REMARKS_on_the_Speech_of_John_Hall_Esq">REMARKS <i>on the Speech of</i> John Hall, <i>Esq</i>;</h2>
</div>


<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE last Sentiments of these two Traitors are so much alike, and there
is such a Harmony betwixt them in Matter, that the Reflections on the
former exhaust all that is material in the latter; so that I shall
only take notice of what is peculiar in Mr. <i>Hall</i>’s, or that is
applicable to his particular Case.</p>


<p class="center">The SPEECH.</p>

<p><i>Friends, Brethren, and Countrymen; I am come here to die for the
sake of God, my King, and my Country; and I heartily rejoice that I am
counted worthy of so great an Honour: for let not any of you think that
I am come to a shameful and ignominious End. The Truth and Justice of
the Cause, for which I suffer, makes my Death a Duty, a Vertue, and an
Honour. Remember that I laid down my Life for asserting the Right of
my only Lawful Sovereign, King</i> James <i>the Third; That I offer my
self as a Victim for the Liberties and Happiness of my dear Country,
and my beloved Fellow-Subjects; That I fall a Sacrifice to Tyranny,
Oppression and Usurpation. In short, consider that I suffer in defence
of the Commands of God, and the Laws and Hereditary Constitution of
the Land: and then know and be assur’d that I am not a Traitor, but a
Martyr.</i></p>


<p class="center"><i>REMARKS.</i></p>

<p>This unfortunate Gentleman sets out with a vile hypocritical
Rhodomontade: he asserts, that he came to die for the sake of God, his
King, and his Country; but ’tis certain, that had his Applications to
the present Government for a Pardon succeeded, he must, according to
this Principle, have liv’d in such a manner as was quite opposite to
what he pretended to die for:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span> which is so horrid, that I may well be
excus’d from saying any thing further about it, since the Antithesis
must be obvious to every Reader.</p>

<p>How much he counted it his Honour to die for the Pretender’s Cause, I
shall not say; but I am well assur’d, that he employ’d all his Friends
to do their utmost for saving his Life, and obtested them to do it, as
they had any regard to the Blessings of himself, his Wife, and five
Children. And I am satisfy’d, that the Reverend Mr. <i>Patten</i> will
own to the World, if it be requir’d, that Mr. <i>Hall</i>, in order to
save his Life, would have had Mr. <i>Patten</i> declare to the Court,
that he the said Mr. <i>Hall</i> was mad; which he thought was as good
a Plea for an <i>English</i> Squire, as for a <i>Scotch</i> Earl. This
makes his End truly ignominious and shameful, and shews that he had
no such Opinion of the Truth and Justice of the Cause for which he
suffer’d, as to make his Death a Duty, Vertue and Honour, till he found
he must come to the Gallows, and there he sets up for a Hero and a
Martyr.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Hall</i>, having acted as a Justice of Peace under the present
Government till the Rebellion broke out, ought to have had some
knowledg of the Law; and therefore we might have expected some Reasons
from the Statute Book, why he calls the Pretender his only Lawful
Sovereign: but ’tis probable he knew, that ’twas not to be done,
and therefore thought it enough to pawn his bare Assertion upon the
Jacobite Mob for <i>Law</i>, as his Fellow-Sufferer the Clergyman did
his for <i>Gospel</i>. ’Tis evident, that both their Talents were
better adapted to Rail, than to Reason; otherwise, the one would have
given us a Text, and the other a Statute, to prove that they suffer’d
in defence of the Laws of God and the Land: but since neither of them
have done it, and that none of the Party either has been, or will ever
be able to do it for them, we have reason to conclude, that they dy’d
Traitors, but not Martyrs.</p>

<p>Those who have read the Old and New Testament with Attention, must
certainly be satisfy’d, that there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span> is not one Word in either for
a Divine Indefeasible Hereditary Right in any Person or Family to
Government; but on the contrary, that our Saviour, the Prophets, and
Apostles, taught Obedience to such Governments and human Constitutions,
as were in being at the respective times when they liv’d; and laid
their Followers under no other Restriction, as to their Obedience to
the Superior Powers they found in the World, but to obey God rather
than Man, when their Commands interfered.</p>

<p>As to the Laws of <i>Great Britain</i>, our Adversaries will never be
able to prove any other Hereditary Right than what was deriv’d from
those Laws; which being alterable, according to the Nature of all human
Constitutions, succeeding Generations must always, according to the
Laws of Nature and Reason, have the same power to alter them for their
own Security, as their Ancestors had to enact them for theirs. If this
be not allow’d, this Absurdity must naturally follow, that had any
preceding King and Parliament made an Act that all their Successors
shou’d be Pagans, Papists, Turks, or Slaves, we had been left without a
Remedy.</p>


<p class="center">The SPEECH.</p>

<p><i>I declare that I die a true and sincere Member of the Church of</i>
England; <i>but not of the Revolution Schismatical Church, whose
Bishops have so rebelliously abandon’d the King, and so shamefully
given up the Rights of the Church, by submitting to the Unlawful,
Invalid, Lay-Deprivations of the Prince of</i> Orange. <i>The Communion
I die in, is that of the True Catholick Nonjuring Church of</i>
England; <i>and I pray God to prosper and increase it, and to grant, if
it be his good pleasure, that it may rise again and flourish.</i></p>


<p class="center"><i>REMARKS.</i></p>

<p>This is so much of a piece with what Parson <i>Paul</i> said in his
Speech, that I need say little more upon it: only Mr. <i>Hall</i> says,
that the Rights of the Church were given up by the Submission of the
Bishops and Clergy to the Unlawful Invalid Lay-Deprivations of the
Prince of <i>Orange</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>The Church of <i>England</i> used formerly, when charg’d with being
<i>Erastian</i> in her Constitution, to alledg that it cou’d not be so,
since the Sovereign of <i>England</i> was <i>mixta Persona</i>, and by
consequence a Clergyman as well as Layman. But tho the High-Church has
thrown up that Argument, ’tis plain from the Statutes quoted in answer
to Mr. <i>Paul</i>, that by the Laws of <i>England</i> our Sovereign
is made Head of the Church; and from him the Bishops and Clergy of
<i>England</i> do immediately derive all their Ecclesiastical Power
and Authority. And since it was the Parliament of <i>England</i> which
invested our Princes with the Power of conferring that Authority,
King <i>William</i> was as lawfully possess’d of it as any of his
Predecessors.</p>

<p>But farther, since all the Episcopal Power which the Bishops of
<i>England</i> can pretend to, is deriv’d from Laymen (if the King
and Parliament must be call’d so) it follows in Reason, that a
Lay-Deprivation is sufficient to make void a Lay-Institution, if the
Deprivation be founded on a just Cause, as disowning the Government
certainly is. Besides, it ought to be consider’d, that the Bishops
who sit in Parliament are Clergymen; and since they consented to the
Deprivation, it can’t in Justice be wholly call’d a Lay one, unless
they had protested against it in Convocation, where they sit as
Clergymen: and that they did not so protest, is evident to all the
World.</p>

<p>’Tis observable, that Mr. <i>Hall</i> adds Catholick to Mr.
<i>Paul</i>’s Epithet of the Nonjuring Church of <i>England</i>; so
that at last the Justice and the Clergyman wou’d bring us to the Church
of <i>Rome</i>, which is the only Church pretending to be Catholick,
that the Nonjuring Church agrees with.</p>


<p class="center">The SPEECH.</p>

<p><i>I heartily beg Pardon of all whom I have in any manner, and at any
time injur’d or offended. I do particularly implore Forgiveness of God
and my King, for having so far swerv’d from my Duty, as to comply with
the Usurpation, in swearing Allegiance to it, and acting in publick
Posts by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span> the Usurper’s Commissions, which were void of all Power and
Authority. God knows my Heart, I did this at first thro Ignorance and
Error; but after I had recollected my self, and inform’d my Judgment
better, I repented, and drew my Sword for the King, and now submit
my self to this violent Death for his sake. I heartily pray God, my
Penitence and my Sufferings may atone for my former Crime. And this I
beg thro the Merits, Mediation, and Sufferings of my dearest Saviour,
Christ Jesus.</i></p>


<p class="center"><i>REMARKS.</i></p>

<p>By this Paragraph we may see whether Mr. <i>Hall</i> was a sincere
Member of the Nonjuring Church or not. He owns, that he had sworn
Allegiance to what he calls the Usurpation, and acted in publick
Posts by Commission from it. This is a plain Proof that he was an
<i>Abjuror</i> instead of a <i>Nonjuror</i>, until the Rebellion
broke out; and then to make himself a sincere Nonjuror, he became a
<i>Perjuror</i>; and contrary to his Allegiance, which he had sworn
from time to time while a Justice of Peace, he drew his Sword against
the King from whom he held his Commission.</p>

<p>He pretends to excuse himself, by saying that his Submission to the
Revolution Government proceeded at first from Ignorance and Error; but
after he had recollected himself, and inform’d his Judgment better, he
repented, and drew his Sword for the King, meaning the Pretender. ’Tis
worth while to observe, how much time Mr. <i>Hall</i> took to recollect
and inform himself better. It certainly was not much, for at the very
time when the Rebellion began, he was sitting with other Justices in
Commission, at the Quarter-Sessions in <i>Northumberland</i>; and he
pretended at his Tryal, that he was taken Prisoner by the Rebels in
his Return from the Quarter-Sessions. By this we may easily know what
to think of his <i>Recollection</i> and <i>better Information</i>. I
shall say no more to this Paragraph, but that Mr. <i>Hall</i> seems
to have dy’d as bad a Protestant as a Subject, since he joins his own
Repentance and Sufferings to the Merits and Sufferings of our Saviour,
as the Foundation of his Hopes for Mercy: which, with what has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span> been
observ’d already in Mr. <i>Paul</i>’s Speech, may serve to convince the
World what sort of Protestants our High-Church-Men are.</p>


<p class="center">The SPEECH.</p>

<p><i>I do sincerely forgive all my Enemies, especially those who have
either caus’d or increas’d the Destructions in Church or State. I pray
God have mercy upon them, and spare them, because they are the Work
of his own Hands, and because they are redeem’d with his Son’s most
precious Blood. I do particularly forgive, from the bottom of my Heart,
the Elector of</i> Brunswick, <i>who murders me; my unjust pretended
Judges and Jury, who convicted, and condemn’d me; Mr.</i> Patten
<i>and Mr.</i> Carnaby, <i>Evidences who swore against me at my Trial.
And I do here declare, upon the Words of a dying Man (and all my</i>
Northumberland <i>Fellow Prisoners can testify the same) that the
Evidence they gave was so far from being the Truth, the whole Truth,
and nothing but the Truth, that in relation to my Indictment they swore
not one true thing against me, but many absolute Falshoods. I pray God
forgive them, for I am sure I do.</i></p>


<p class="center"><i>REMARKS.</i></p>

<p>His way of forgiving his Enemies is much the same with Parson
<i>Paul</i>’s. Here his Folly and Malice are equally conspicuous; for
in this Paragraph he charges the Evidence against him with swearing
falsly; whereas in that immediately preceding, he owns the Truth of
what is sworn in the main, by confessing that he drew his Sword for
King <i>James</i>, which is a sufficient Vindication of the Evidence.</p>


<p class="center">The SPEECH.</p>

<p><i>Lastly, I forgive all who had any hand in the Surrender at</i>
Preston; <i>for they have surrender’d away my Life: and I would to God
that were the only bad Consequence of it. But alas, it is too plain,
that the Surrenderers not only ruin’d many of his Majesty’s brave and
faithful Subjects but gave up their King and Country into the Bargain.
For it was then in their power to have restor’d the King with Triumph
to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span> Throne; and thereby to have made us a happy People. We had
repuls’d our Enemies at every Attack, and were ready, willing, and able
to have attack’d them. On our side even our common Men were brave,
courageous and resolute; on the other hand, theirs were directly the
contrary: insomuch that after they had run away from our first Fire,
they could never be brought so much as to endeavour to stand a second.
This I think my self oblig’d in Justice to mention, that Mr.</i> Wills
<i>may not impose upon the World, as if he and his Troops had conquer’d
us, and gain’d the Victory: for the truth is, after we had conquer’d
them, our Superiours thought fit to capitulate, and ruin us. I wish
them God’s and the King’s Pardon for it.</i></p>


<p class="center"><i>REMARKS.</i></p>

<p>This Paragraph is such a fulsom and flagrant Lye, that it would seem
the Devil ow’d him a shame. To publish an Untruth of this nature,
in view of the Bar of Heaven, proves the poor Man, or at least his
Speech-makers, to have been more than case-harden’d. What the
Design of the Faction could be, in handing such a Story as this to
the World, which can be contradicted by Thousands of Eye-Witnesses,
and by Mr. <i>Hall</i>’s Fellow-Rebels as well as by the King’s
Troops, is not easy to be imagin’d; unless it be to spirit up the
Faction to a new Rebellion, by telling them, that their Friends were
Conquerors, but unhappily betray’d into a Surrender by their Leaders.
Had this been true, what Fools must their Generals <i>Forster</i> and
<i>Mackintosh</i> be to fly from a Government, where they had so much
Merit to plead, to another which will certainly hang them, if Mr.
<i>Hall</i>’s Accusation obtain Belief? One would be tempted to think,
that when Mr. <i>Hall</i> read or sign’d this Speech, he did not expect
to have been hang’d, but to have been rescu’d by the Jacobite Mob, and
to have set himself at their Head as General; a Post which (if he says
true) he certainly deserv’d much better than Lord <i>Derwentwater</i>,
Lord <i>Kenmure</i>, or Messieurs <i>Forster</i> and <i>Mackintosh</i>.
But be that how it will, if the Rebels make another Attempt, ’tis
probable this scandalous Reflection may put our Generals and Soldiers
upon another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span> Method of managing the War, than to content themselves
with the Surrender of the Jacobites at Discretion: and of what Service
Mr. <i>Hall</i>’s Speech may be to his Party in this Case, they
themselves are left to judg.</p>


<p class="center">The SPEECH.</p>

<p><i>May it please the Almighty to bless, preserve, and restore our
only Rightful and Lawful Sovereign, King</i> James <i>the Third! May
he direct his Councils, and prosper his Arms! May he bring him to his
Kingdom, and set the Crown upon his Head! May he protect him from the
Malice of his Enemies, and defend him from those who for a Reward
would slay him innocent! May he grant him in Health and Wealth long to
live! May he strengthen him, that he may vanquish and overcome all his
Enemies! And finally, when it pleases his infinite Wisdom to take him
out of this World, may he take him to himself, and reward him with an
everlasting Crown of Glory in the next!</i></p>


<p class="center"><i>REMARKS.</i></p>

<p>All that I shall say to this Paragraph, is, that the Prayers of the
Worshipful Justice, and the Reverend Parson, are much of the same
Strain, and, no doubt, they’ll meet with the like Answer. Indeed the
Justice appears to have been the better Churchman of the two, for he
prays for the Church in his second Paragraph, and puts off his Prayers
for the King almost till the last; and the Parson shews himself to have
been a better Lawyer than the Justice, because he prays for his King
first, as the Head of his Church.</p>


<p class="center">The SPEECH.</p>

<p><i>These, my beloved Countrymen, are the sincere Prayers, these the
last Words of me, who am now a dying Person. And if you have any regard
to the last Breath of one who is just going out of the World, let me
beg of you to be dutiful, obedient, and loyal to your only Sovereign
Liege Lord, King</i> James <i>the Third: be ever ready to serve him,
and be sure you never fail to use all your Endeavours to restore him;
and whatever the Consequence be, remember that you have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span> a good Cause,
and a gracious God, and expect your Recompence from him.</i></p>

<p><i>To that God, the God of Truth and Holiness, the Rewarder of all
who suffer for Righteousness sake, I commend my Soul; beseeching him
to have mercy upon it, for the sake of my dear Redeemer, and merciful
Saviour, Jesus Christ, our Lord.</i> Amen. Amen. Amen.</p>

<p class="center"><i>REMARKS.</i></p>

<p>The Justice agrees with the Parson in his Attempts to excite the
Jacobites to a new Rebellion; but the Justice has fallen upon the
luckier Argument of the two, because, in a former Paragraph, he
encourages them with the News of a Victory, which it seems the Parson
knew nothing of, tho present in the Field of Battle, and never saw any
Marks of Triumph on that account, till he and his Brother Justice came
to rejoice together for it at the Triple-Tree. The Justice however
dy’d the best Protestant, because he begs pardon for the sake of his
Redeemer, and does not seem to rely altogether upon his own Merits, as
the Parson did.</p>


<p class="center">POSTSCRIPT.</p>

<p><i>I might reasonably have expected my Life would have been saved,
since I had obtained five Reprieves: but I find that the Duke of</i>
Hannover, <i>and his Evil Counsellors who guide him, have so little
Virtue and Honour themselves, that they are resolv’d not to spare my
Life, because I would not purchase it upon base and dishonourable
Terms. I have reason to think, that at first I could have secur’d both
Life and Fortune, if I would have pleaded Guilty; and I doubt not but I
might since have obtain’d Favour, if I would have petition’d in a vile
scandalous manner. But I was resolv’d to do nothing whereby I should
have disown’d my King, and deny’d my Principles: and I thank my good
God, both for inspiring me with this holy Resolution, and for giving me
the Grace to perform it.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>REMARKS.</i></p>

<p>This is so malicious and silly, that it carries its Antidote along with
it. He was oblig’d to the Government for five Reprieves, and if we may
believe what he says, ’tis entirely owing to himself that he did not
obtain a Pardon, because he would not petition. ’Twas highly reasonable
then, that when Mercy wou’d not do, Justice shou’d take place. ’Tis
certain, that a Petition for Mercy cou’d be nothing so vile, as
forfeiting his Life by Perjury and Rebellion. But by this we see what
aukard Notions our Jacobites have of what they call Honour.</p>

<p>I shall conclude the whole with observing, that these two Speeches are
enough to convince the World, that the Oaths of the High-Church Party
are not to be trusted while living, nor their Speeches when dead.</p>

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
